# Cirrhosis Survival Prediction
## Overview
This project uses Machine Learning (ML) models to predict cirrhosis patient survival, integrating data analysis, preprocessing, and advanced modeling techniques. 

## Techniques used
### Data Analysis and Preprocessing
- Identification and treatment of variables that require preprocessing to ensure data quality and readiness for analysis.
- Separate handling and preprocessing strategies for numerical and categorical data to optimize their utility in predictive modeling.
- Analysis of variables in relation to the target outcome to identify significant predictors.
- Identification and treatment of outliers to improve model accuracy and robustness.
- Techniques applied to manage missing values and encode categorical variables for model readiness.
- Addressing data imbalance to ensure model fairness and accuracy across different patient profiles.
